# Build & Push Docker Image - GitHub Action

This GitHub Action automates the process of building a Docker image for your application, logging into a Docker registry, and pushing the image to the registry with versioning based on the current Git commit.

## Inputs

|--------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `registry_url`     | `true`   | The URL of the Docker registry (e.g., `registry1.azurecr.io`) |
| `client_id`        | `true`   | The Client ID used for logging into the Docker registry       |
| `client_secret`    | `true`   | The Client Secret used for logging into the Docker registry   |
| `dockerfile_path`  | `true`   | The path to the Dockerfile                                    |
| `application_name` | `true`   | The name of the application being containerized               |

## Steps Overview

1. **Calculate Version**: Generates a short Git commit SHA to use as a unique tag for the Docker image.
2. **Login to Docker Registry**: Logs into your Docker registry using the provided credentials.
3. **Build and Push Docker Image**: Builds the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile and pushes it to the registry. The image is tagged with both the short SHA and the `latest` tag.
